This guide describes the four main opponent tendency categories and how to identify them based on their playing patterns.

## 1. Tight Opponent

### Definition
A **Tight** opponent plays a **narrow range of hands** - only premium and strong hands. They fold frequently and only enter pots with quality holdings.

### Characteristics

**Pre-Flop Behavior:**
- Opens/raises with **top 20-30% of hands** (approximately ranks 1-50)
- Folds **70-80% of hands** pre-flop
- Only plays: Premium pairs (AA-99), Strong aces (AK, AQ, AJ), Strong kings (KQ, KJ), Strong suited connectors
- Rarely bluffs pre-flop
- Very selective about which hands to play

**Betting Patterns:**
- Raises when they have strong hands
- Folds to most raises unless they have premium holdings
- 3-bets only with very strong hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK)
- Consistent, predictable betting when they do play

**Post-Flop (for context):**
- Continues betting with strong hands
- Folds quickly when they miss the flop
- Rarely bluffs
- Value bets with made hands

### How to Identify a Tight Opponent

**Key Indicators:**
1. **Low VPIP (Voluntarily Put money In Pot):** <30%
   - They fold most hands pre-flop
   - Only enter pots with strong hands

2. **High Fold to 3-bet:** >70%
   - When you 3-bet, they fold most of the time
   - Only continues with premium hands

3. **Low Opening Frequency:** Opens <40% of hands from Button
   - Folds many playable hands
   - Only opens with strong holdings

4. **Rare 3-bets:** 3-bets <10% of the time

- "They folded to my button raise 15 out of 20 times"

### How to Exploit Tight Opponents

**Strategy:**
- **Play wider range** - They fold too much, so you can steal blinds more
- **Bluff more** - They fold to aggression frequently
- **3-bet lighter** - They fold to 3-bets often
- **Value bet thinner** - They call with strong hands, so bet for value with medium strength

**Hands to Play:**

## 7. Unknown Opponent

### Definition
An **Unknown** opponent is one you haven't observed enough to categorize. You need to make assumptions based on default strategies.

### Default Assumptions

**Conservative Approach (Recommended):**
- Assume they're **Tight-Aggressive** until proven otherwise
- Play tighter range (top 40-50% of hands)
- Need stronger hands to call 3-bets
- Be cautious until you gather more information

**Aggressive Approach:**
- Assume they're **Loose-Passive** (easiest to exploit)
- Play wider range (top 60-70% of hands)
- Bluff more frequently
- Adjust as you learn more

### How to Gather Information

1. **Observe first 10-20 hands:**
   - Track opening frequency
   - Track 3-bet frequency
   - Track fold frequency

2. **Start conservative:**
   - Play tighter range initially
   - Observe their patterns

3. **Adjust quickly:**
   - Once you identify their type, adjust strategy
   - Exploit their weaknesses

## 9. Practical Tips

### Identifying Opponents in Real-Time

1. **Keep mental notes:**
   - Track their actions over last 10-20 hands
   - Note patterns in their play

2. **Look for consistency:**
   - Do they always fold to 3-bets? → Tight/Passive
   - Do they 3-bet frequently? → Aggressive
   - Do they call with weak hands? → Loose

3. **Adjust quickly:**
   - Once you identify type, adjust immediately
   - Don't wait for perfect information

4. **Re-evaluate:**
   - Opponents can change strategies
   - Keep observing and adjusting

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-adjusting:** Don't change strategy too drastically based on small sample
2. **Under-adjusting:** Don't ignore clear patterns
3. **Stereotyping:** Not all tight players are the same
4. **Ignoring context:** Stack size, position, and game flow matter

## 10. Integration with Module 1

The system uses these opponent types in the knowledge base:

- **Tight:** Requires stronger hands (Marginal+ from Button)
- **Loose:** Can play wider range (Playable+ from Button)
- **Aggressive:** Requires stronger hands (Strong+ from Button)
- **Passive:** Can play wider range (Playable+ from Button)
- **Unknown:** Default to conservative (Playable+ from Button, Strong+ from BB)

These categories help the propositional logic rules determine hand playability based on opponent tendencies.
