# Absolute Fold Situations in Heads-Up Pre-Flop Poker

Based on hand rankings and strategic principles, here are situations where you should **absolutely fold** in heads-up pre-flop play.

## 1. Worst Hands (Bottom Tier - Ranks 117-169)

### The Absolute Worst Hands (<40% win rate)
These hands have **<40% equity** and should almost always fold:

| Rank | Hand | Win % | When to Fold |
|------|------|-------|--------------|
| 169 | **23o** | 32.21% | Always fold |
| 168 | **24o** | 33.43% | Always fold |
| 167 | **26o** | 33.75% | Always fold |
| 166 | **25o** | 33.90% | Always fold |
| 165 | **27o** | 34.29% | Always fold |
| 164 | **23s** | 35.23% | Always fold |
| 163 | **34o** | 35.63% | Always fold |
| 162 | **35o** | 35.85% | Always fold |
| 161 | **36o** | 35.95% | Always fold |
| 160 | **38o** | 36.48% | Always fold |
| 159 | **28o** | 36.49% | Always fold |
| 158 | **37o** | 36.60% | Always fold |
| 157 | **24s** | 36.69% | Always fold |
| 156 | **26s** | 37.28% | Always fold |
| 155 | **25s** | 37.44% | Always fold |
| 154 | **27s** | 37.87% | Always fold |

**Rule:** Any hand with **<38% win rate** should be folded in virtually all situations.

## 2. Weak Hands from Big Blind (Out of Position)

### Situation: Facing a Button Raise with Weak Hands

**Always fold these hands from Big Blind when facing a raise:**

- **All Weak tier hands** (ranks 117-169, <45% win rate)
- **Most Marginal hands** (ranks 88-116, 45-50% win rate) unless:
  - You have pot odds (already invested 1 BB)
  - Opponent is very loose/passive
  - Stack depth allows post-flop play

**Examples:**
- **72o** (rank 169, 32.21%) - Always fold
- **83o** (rank 160, 36.48%) - Always fold
- **94o** (rank 138, 41.23%) - Fold unless very specific conditions
- **T5o** (rank 121, 43.89%) - Fold from BB

**Reasoning:** Out of position disadvantage makes weak hands unprofitable. You'll be playing guessing games post-flop.

## 3. Weak Hands with Short Stacks

### Situation: Stack < 20 Big Blinds

**Always fold these hands with short stacks:**

- **All Weak tier hands** (ranks 117-169)
- **All Marginal hands** (ranks 88-116) unless premium
- **Most Playable hands** (ranks 61-87) unless Strong+

**Stack Size Guidelines:**
- **<10 BB:** Only play Premium hands (ranks 1-30, ≥60% win rate)
- **10-20 BB:** Only play Strong+ hands (ranks 1-60, ≥55% win rate)
- **20+ BB:** Can play wider ranges

**Examples:**
- **K9s** (rank 34, 59.29%) with 15 BB vs Aggressive - **Fold** (needs Strong+)
- **QJo** (rank 39, 58.49%) with 12 BB - **Fold** (needs Premium)
- **72o** (rank 169, 32.21%) with any stack - **Always fold**

---

## 4. Weak Hands Against Aggressive Opponents

### Situation: Opponent is Aggressive (3-bets frequently)

**Always fold these hands against aggressive opponents:**

- **All Weak tier hands** (ranks 117-169)
- **All Marginal hands** (ranks 88-116)
- **Most Playable hands** (ranks 61-87) unless Strong+

**Reasoning:** Aggressive opponents will 3-bet you frequently, making weak hands unprofitable. You need stronger hands to:
1. Call 3-bets profitably
2. 4-bet for value
3. Avoid being pushed off marginal hands

**Examples:**
- **78s** (rank 107, 46.63%) vs Aggressive - **Fold**
- **69o** (rank 122, 43.82%) vs Aggressive - **Fold**
- **45s** (rank 135, 41.66%) vs Aggressive - **Fold**

---

## 5. Weak Hands Against Tight Opponents

### Situation: Opponent is Tight (only plays premium hands)

**Always fold these hands against tight opponents:**

- **All Weak tier hands** (ranks 117-169)
- **All Marginal hands** (ranks 88-116)
- **Most Playable hands** (ranks 61-87) unless Strong+

**Reasoning:** Tight opponents only play strong hands. When they raise, they likely have you dominated. Weak hands can't compete.

**Examples:**
- **89o** (rank 101, 48.11%) vs Tight - **Fold**
- **67s** (rank 115, 45.64%) vs Tight - **Fold**
- **58o** (rank 136, 41.66%) vs Tight - **Fold**

## Summary: The Absolute Fold Rule

**You should ABSOLUTELY fold when:**

1. ✅ **Hand rank 117-169** (Weak tier, <45% win rate) - **Always fold**
2. ✅ **Hand rank 88-116** (Marginal tier) from **Big Blind** facing a raise
3. ✅ **Hand rank 88-116** (Marginal tier) with **stack < 20 BB**
4. ✅ **Hand rank 88-116** (Marginal tier) vs **Aggressive** opponent
5. ✅ **Hand rank 88-116** (Marginal tier) vs **Tight** opponent
6. ✅ **Any hand rank 117-169** (Weak tier) regardless of position/stack/opponent
7. ✅ **Hand rank 61-87** (Playable tier) with **stack < 10 BB**
8. ✅ **Hand rank 61-87** (Playable tier) from **Big Blind** vs **Aggressive/Tight**

**The Bottom 53 Hands (Ranks 117-169) should be folded in 99% of situations.**

Only exception: When you're in Big Blind and Button checks (no raise), you can see a flop with almost any hand due to pot odds (already invested 1 BB).
